Description: Multidimensional systems allow complex queries to be 
    carried out in an easy way. The geographical dimension, 
    together with the temporal dimension, plays a fundamental 
    role in multidimensional systems. Through this package, vector 
    layers can be associated to the attributes of geographic 
    dimensions, so that the results of multidimensional queries 
    can be obtained directly as vector layers. The multidimensional 
    structures on which we can define the queries can be created 
    from a flat table or imported directly using functions from 
    this package.
